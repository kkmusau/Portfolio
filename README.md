## Description
A professional portfolio page that features at least three projects from the Full-Stack Bootcamp, a contact section that includes my personal email, github profile, and downloadable resume page.

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio that showcases my work as a developer. This portfolio will eventually be used to show perspective employers.
